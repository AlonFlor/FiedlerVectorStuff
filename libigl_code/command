commands to compile:

	Heat Geodesics:
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ heat_geodesics.cpp -o heat_geodesics
	Directed Curvatures:
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ directed_curvatures.cpp -o directed_curvatures
	Gaussian Curvatures:
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ Gaussian_curvatures.cpp -o Gaussian_curvatures

	other:
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ code.cpp -o stuff
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ more_code.cpp -o more_stuff
		g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I./libigl/include/ b.cpp -o b
		
commands to run:
	Heat Geodesics:
		./heat_geodesics <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name>
	
		each pair of <number of runs> <file name> tells the program how many times to run a file, and which file to run that many times.
	
		example:
			./heat_geodesics 5 scrambled_xyzrgb_dragon_digital_connected.ply 5 xyzrgb_dragon_digital_connected.ply 5 reordered_xyzrgb_dragon_digital_connected.ply
					
	Directed Curvatures:
		./directed_curvatures <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name>
		
		same pattern as Heat Geodesics
		
	Gaussian Curvatures:
		./Gaussian_curvatures <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name>
		
		same pattern as Heat Geodesics
