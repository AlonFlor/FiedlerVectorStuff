template of command to use to run:
	./stuff <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name> <number of runs> <file name>
	
	each pair of <number of runs> <file name> tells the program how many times to run a file, and which file to run that many times.
	
	example:
		./stuff 5 dragon.veg 5 reordered_dragon.veg 5 scrambled_dragon.veg

command to use to compile:
	g++ -std=c++11 -iprefix../VegaFEM-v4.0/libraries/ basic_VegaFEM_code.cpp -o stuff -L../VegaFEM-v4.0/libraries/glui/glui-2.35/src/lib -lglui -L../VegaFEM-v4.0/libraries/lib -lsceneObject -lintegratorSparse -lintegrator -lstencilForceModel -lforceModel -llistIO -llighting -lconfigFile -lvolumetricMesh -lgetopts -lcamera -lgraph -lisotropicHyperelasticFEM -lstvk -lcorotationalLinearFEM -lsparseMatrix -lconstrainedDOFs -lpolarDecomposition -lminivector -lmatrixIO -lmassSpringSystem -lmesh -lobjMesh -lopenGLHelper -limageIO -lsparseSolver -lbasicAlgorithms -lGL -lGLU -lglut

Notes:
	Header-only libraries only need include flags and the files and/or directories to include, so -I (or in this case -iprefix) gives what is needed.
	Libraries that are not header-only require both include flags and linking.
	Includes (-I, -iprefix, etc.) point the way to header files, linking points the way to libraries (.so and .a files).
	If a library's name is liblibrary.a or liblibrary.so, then it is linked via -llibrary, and its directory's location is specified with the -L flag.
	Order matters! "g++ -std=c++11" goes first, then the header inclusions, then the c++ files, the optimizer flag, the name of the binary, then at the end are the links.
	Within the links, order matters. If liba.a depends on libb.a, then -la must come before -lb. In the call above, note that -lglut is at the end.
	VegaFEM libraries I need are in the makefile for interactiveDeformableSimulator, in the utilities folder in the VegaFEM-v4.0 folder.
	The makefile for interactiveDeformableSimulator includes a shorthand for linking the VegaFEM libraries. I might copy it sometime.



old command (ignore, kept since the paths the eigen3 and ilbigl might be useful later):
g++ -std=c++11 -lpthread -I/usr/include/eigen3 -I../../../libigl/include/ code.cpp -o stuff
